# Creating Relations: Assignment

## Overview

At Thinkful Books, your business is booming. However, your Customer Support team has been struggling to handle an increasing number of questions from customers about the books available at your store. Currently, your inventory is recorded in a physical notebook, so your team has to consult and look up records manually to find answers to your customers' questions.

Customers would like to know, for example, if Thinkful Books currently has any historical books written during the Second World War between 1939 - 1945 in stock. Other customers might like to view all the books in your inventory written by a certain author. Your employees might also need a list of books that are out of stock so they can plan next month's inventory accordingly.

To help answer these questions more efficiently, you have decided to create and link a few additional tables in your database so that your team can easily access the information desired by your customers and your employees.

## Instructions

For this checkpoint to considered complete, you must get all the tests to pass.

## Tasks

After brainstorming with your employees, you created the following ERD to represent the additional tables you would need:

[ERD: Books, Authors, Genres Tables](/books-authors-genres-erd.png)

And now, you are ready to translate the ERD above into SQL tables.

For each of the following files, create the queries as described.

1. `setup/authors.sql`, `setup/books.sql`, `setup/genres.sql`, `setup/books_genres.sql`: Write queries to create the new tables in your database based on the ERD provided above.

2. `src/get-all-books-by-author.sql`: Write a query to return a list of all book and author-related fields for all books written by "Amy Tan".

3. `src/get-all-books-not-in-stock.sql`: Write a query to return a list of all book and author-related fields for all books that are currently out of stock.

4. `src/get-all-books-by-country.sql`: Write a query to return a list of all book and author-related fields for all books written by an author from "China" or "Turkey".

5. `src/count-books.sql`: Write a query to return the number of books "Leo Tolstoy" wrote.

6. `src/count-books-before-year.sql`: Write a query to return the number of books written before 2000.

7. `src/get-all-books-before-year-by-nationality.sql`: Write a query to return a list of all book and author-related fields for all books written before 2005 by non-US authors.

8. `src/get-all-authors-by-title-length.sql`: Write a query to return a list of all authors who have written books whose titles are longer than 25 characters.

9. `src/get-all-books-by-author-by-genre.sql`: Write a query to return a list of all book and author-related fields for all books written by "Leo Tolstoy" that belong to either the "autobiography" or "history" genres.
